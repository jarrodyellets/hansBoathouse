  <div>This is where you would find press for Hans' Boathouse.  Unfortunately, Hans' Boathouse doesn't exits.  It exists solely as a figment of my imagination.  If it did exist tho, I'm sure they would have lots and lots of glowing reviews.  If you are disappointed because you had a desire to eat seafood, and discovered the restaurant you thought was real was actually fake, rest assure that there are loads of good seafood restaurants all over the world.  I would recommend Google, or if you are feeling adventurous, a phone book to find the seafood restaurant closest to you.</div>
